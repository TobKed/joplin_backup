[github] GitHub Actions - clean old workflows

# GitHub Actions - clean old workflows

\# https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re06c949e1ab7114239362b13b729b1996dfd3fc60c5ef892e4df80e2%40%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E



Just a note that I've \_finally\_ found a way to tidy up the list of workflows we have in https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions and that now shows only the "active"/used workflows we have.



To delete a workflow from that list you have to delete the yaml file, which we had already done, and also delete all the old workflow runs too. Which did with for loops and jq :)

This will print the workflow ID and the name. Cross check this in the UI with which ones are still running

gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/workflows --paginate | /usr/sbin/jq '.workflows\[] | "\\(.id) \\(.name)"



For everyone that isn't running, go and delete all the old runs:

for run in $(gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/workflows/\<workflow\_id>/runs --paginate | jq '.workflow\_runs\[].id') ;do gh api -X DELETE repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs/$run | cat; done

(Only committers can do this last step I'd hope)

Enojy!

```


```

```
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/workflows --paginate | /usr/sbin/jq '.workflows[] | "\(.id) \(.name)"
$(gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/workflows/<workflow_id>/runs --paginate | jq '.workflow_runs[].id') ;do gh api -X DELETE repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs/$run | cat; done
```
