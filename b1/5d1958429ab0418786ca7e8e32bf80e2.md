[python]  pytest commands

# python - pytest commands

```
pytest -k test_funct_namee
 pytest -x: runs the entire test suite but quits at the first test that fails
pytest --lf: re-runs any tests that failed during the last test run
pytest --pdb -x: open the Python debugger at the first failed test (omit the -x to open it at every failed test). This is the main way I interact with the Python debugger. I often use this to help write the tests, since I can add assert False and get a shell inside the test to interact with various objects and figure out how to best run assertions against them

* `pytest -x`: runs the entire test suite but quits at the first test that fails
* `pytest --lf`: re-runs any tests that failed during the last test run
* `pytest --pdb -x`: open the Python debugger at the first failed test (omit the `-x` to open it at every failed test). This is the main way I interact with the Python debugger. I often use this to help write the tests, since I can add `assert False` and get a shell inside the test to interact with various objects and figure out how to best run assertions against them
